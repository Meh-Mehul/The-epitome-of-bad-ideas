This is a project for a webserver hosted on an ESP8266 hosting three websites for doing various things, like chatting, image upload, game.
## Why?
Because i had a lot of time at hand and kinda wanted to start learning about backend stuff too, this is bascially a very scaled down small version of an insecure webserver working via socket protocol
## How to set up?
Just put in ur credentials for WiFi (its preffered that the WiFi is not a public one or an institution's), find the IP of the webserver (if connected to a phone hotspot one can see it in thier phone settings).

Now, just give the ESP8266 the code and power and the webserver is set up and can be accessed by anyone in that network provided that they know the right IP
Here's how the websites will look after they are set up throught ESP8266
